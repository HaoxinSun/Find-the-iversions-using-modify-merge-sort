Find-the-iversions-using-modify-merge-sort
==========================================

Find the iversions using modify merge sort ,the worst running time theta(nlgn)
let A[1...n] be a array of n distinct numbers, if the subscript i <j , having A[i]>A[j],then the pair(i,j) 
is called an inversion of A
The algorithm here in theta(nlgn) the worst-case time
